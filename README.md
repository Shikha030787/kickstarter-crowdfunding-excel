# Kickstarter Crowdfunding Excel Data Analytics Project
# What is Kickstarter?
Thousands of creative projects are funding on Kickstarter at any given moment. Each project is independently created and crafted by the person behind it. The filmmakers, musicians, artists, and designers you see on Kickstarter have complete control and responsibility over their projects. They spend weeks building their project pages, shooting their videos, and brainstorming what rewards to offer backers. When they're ready, creators launch their project and share it with their community. Every project creator sets their project's funding goal and deadline. If people like the project, they can pledge money to make it happen. If the project succeeds in reaching its funding goal, all backers' credit cards are charged when time expires. If the project falls short, no one is charged. Funding on Kickstarter is all-or-nothing.

# Why do people back projects?
- Alot of backers are rallying around their friends' projects. Some are supporting people they've long admired. Many are just inspired by a new idea.
- Others are inspired by a project's rewards — a copy of what's being made,a limited edition,or a custom experience related to the project.
- Backing a project is more than just giving someone money. It's supporting their dream to create something that they want to see exist in the world.
- One of the main reasons as for why people support certain projects is because of the reward system, people want acknowledgment.
- People pledge on Kickstarter and as they like the project.
- They want to get benefited in some way and see the social benefits.
- They want to be involved in something, be part of the group.
- People usually support the project, which they know that it fits with their values.
- People believe that they’ll get a special discounted price for backing the project and special perks, which they wouldn’t receive otherwise.
